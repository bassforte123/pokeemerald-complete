# Trait System (Beta)

- General terminology I'm going for is:
   - Ability = Same as vanilla.
   - Innate = Additional abilities that are the same for all members of a species.
   - Trait = Encompassing term for either one
  Note: for the sake of making merging a little easier, "Ability" is still used in many places when "Trait" is intended.

- This is a beta both to see if anyone catches any sort of major formatting or bugs I should address now before I proceed and also just to actually get something out there after talking about it so much.
- To add Innates you just need to add a new .innates parameter underneath the existing .abilities one using the same formatting.  Bulbasaur and Torchic have examples commented out.
   - ex: .innates = { ABILITY_PROTEAN, ABILITY_ROUGH_SKIN, ABILITY_CLEAR_BODY },
- The basic code design is all Ability checks have been replaced with Trait checks, reading all passives a pokemon has whenever an Ability is looked for.  All previously mutually exclusive abilities like the weather ones which use a Switch Case format has been replaced with If statements so that they can all be called anyway (though natually any abilities that actually conflict will overwrite by code order, Drought and Snow Warning will both activate, but Snow Warning is later in the list so ultimately the weather will be snow/hail.  Really this is only a consideration for future randomizer settings.
- Uses the MAX_MON_INNATES variable to control how many Innates are available, default is 3 totaling up to 4 active abilities per pokemon.
- Ability popups have been modified into a Stack system so that when multiple abilities are triggered at once, they are stored then read out in the correct order.  Battle Message logic has also been updated to account for the new timings.
- There's a new Summary page that displays the pokemon's Ability and up to 3 Innates.  Currently it only works in the overworld but it still works to let you confirm innates are in place.
- Abilities that affect other abilities such as Trace or Neutralizing Gas only affect the original Ability still, Innates will remain active.

Basic code design comes from old Emerald Redux code with permission.

### Important: DO NOT use GitHub's "Download Zip" option. Using this option will not download the commit history required to update your expansion version or merge other feature branches. Instead, please read [this guide](https://github.com/Pawkkie/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo/wiki/The-Basics-of-GitHub) to learn how to fork the repository and clone locally from there.

## What is pokeemerald-expansion?

pokeemerald-expansion is a decomp hack base project based off pret's [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project. It's recommended that any new projects that plan on using it, to clone this repository instead of pret's vanilla repository, as we regurlarly incorporate pret's documentation changes. This is ***NOT*** a standalone romhack, and as such, most features will be unavailable and/or unbalanced if played as is.

If you use pokeemerald-expansion in your hack, please add RHH (Rom Hacking Hideout) to your credits list. Optionally, you can list the version used, so it can help players know what features to expect.
You can phrase it as the following:
```
Based off RHH's pokeemerald-expansion 1.9.3 https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/
```

### [Documentation on features can be found here](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/wiki)

## If I already have a project based on regular pokeemerald, can I use pokeemerald-expansion?
Yes! Keep in mind that we keep up with pret's documentation of pokeemerald, which means that if your project a bit old, you might get merge conflicts that you need to solve manually.
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH master`.

With this, you'll get the latest version of pokeemerald-expansion, plus a couple of bugfixes that haven't been released into the next patch version :)

## **How do I update my version of pokeemerald-expansion?**
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Check your current version.
    - You can check in the debug menu's `Utilities -> Expansion Version` option.
    - If the option is not available, you possibly have version 1.6.2 or older. In that case, please check the [changelogs](CHANGELOG.md) to determine your version based on the features available on your repository.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH expansion/X.Y.Z`, replacing X, Y and Z with the digits of the respective version you want to update to (eg, to update to 1.9.3, use `git pull RHH expansion/1.9.3`).
    - ***Important:*** If you are several versions behind, we recommend updating one minor version at a time, skipping directly to the latest patch version (eg, 1.5.3 -> 1.6.2 -> 1.7.4 and so on)
- Alternatively, you can update to unreleased versions of the expansion.
    - ***master (stable):*** It contains unreleased **bugfixes** that will come in the next patch version. To merge, use `git pull RHH master`.
    - ***upcoming (unstable, with potential bugs):*** It contains unreleased **features** that will come in the next minor version. To merge, use `git pull RHH upcoming`.
